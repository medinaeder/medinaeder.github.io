title: Markdown Madness

I haven't found the perfect markdown viewer for my needs. 

Rather than spend more time searching for a new viewer, I think a simple bash script will suffice. 

Here is a file I call `mdit`.

```
#!/bin/bash

tmpfile=$(mktemp).pdf
pandoc $1 -o $tmpfile
evince $tmpfile
rm $tmpfile
```

Simply save the above as whatever file you want to call it and place it wherever you want. 
In my case it will go in `~/.local/bin/`.

It is good enough for me but may not be good enough for you.
