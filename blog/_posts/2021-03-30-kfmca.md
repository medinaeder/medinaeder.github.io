title: algorithmic similarities

*Warning: This post will not be insightful but is a mere collection of thoughts.* 

I am not the first to say this but Kalman Filters and CMA-ES smell like they are one and the same. 

[Kalman filtering (KF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter) is an algorithm that uses a series of measurements with noise to produce estimates of unknown variables. 
[CMA-ES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMA-ES) (covariance matrix adaptation-evolutionary strategy) is a stochastic method for optimizing nonlinear functions. 

I think that the KF estimates of the unknown variables are the solutions to an optimization problem that seeks to minimize uncertainty. If this framework is made expect CMA-ES to fall out. 

I wonder if this is another case where the same process has been discovered by different communities and given the same name. 

It could also be the case that--- as my French friend who is learning English idioms --- "there is more than one way to skin a cat".
