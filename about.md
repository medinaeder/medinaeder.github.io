<p class="message">
    I am PhD Candidate in engineering science at Harvard University where I work with
    <a href="https://bertoldi.seas.harvard.edu"> Katia Bertoldi</a> and 
    <a href="https://people.seas.harvard.edu/~chr/"> Chris Rycroft</a>. My research interests 
    are broad spanning experimental and computional mechanics, optimization, and biomedical engineering. 

    My current research topic involves understanding, exploring, and optimizing nonlinear mechanical structures.
