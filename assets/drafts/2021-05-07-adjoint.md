title: Adjoint Method
---

*AZ this post is for you.*

If you solve large scale optimization problems you will often encounter the adjoint method. 
It is such a useful algorithm/method that I am always quite surprised when people have never heard of it. 

I am also surprised when people in the ML community seem to have never heard of it. 
But they have! 
The adjoint method is just a vector Jacobian product!

At high level, the adjoint method is a numerical method used to compute the gradient of a constrained objective with respect to a control variable. 


Discuss the reduced objective formulation. 

Discuss the relation to networks. Show that lambda shows up as the output of a layer.
